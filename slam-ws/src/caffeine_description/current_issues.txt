Current Issues:
- Stand is wrong in general
- Mass values are wrong in general
- Base isn't correct (must be hexagonal!)
- LIDAR laser seems to be hitting itself meaning some sort filtering
or something has to be done (I'm not sure yet); temporarily adjusted the min range distance. Also LIDAR properties must be accurate to real life hokuyo sensor (currently it's not)
- Casters move unrealistically
