# Getting Started with ROS

This project is the result of following the [getting started with ros](https://github.com/UTRA-ART/SLAM/wiki#getting-started-with-ros) tutorials on our [wiki](https://github.com/UTRA-ART/SLAM/wiki).

>**Note:** If you are unfamiliar with ROS, we suggest you follow our tutorials instead of just cloning this branch. We have provided it here just so you have a reference of the structure.
